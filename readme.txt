Important Release Candidate information
=======================================
Release Candidates (recognisable on the abbreviation RC in the download name) are meant to be prelimary distributes before the actual release. Release Candidates of plugins - use at your own risk.
All release candidates are tested on e107 v0.7.8 and v.0.7.25. Possible new e107 features might be used and therefore this module might not function correctly on earlier versions, however for e107 0.7.7 this module is expected to run okay. It is strongly advised to test this module before implementing it on a live website.

1. Fresh install:
=================
a. Unzip the files.
b. Upload the EasyShop plugin files into your 'e107_plugins' folder. Although 'Upload plugin' from the Admin section might work, uploading your plugin files by using an FTP client program is recommended.
c. When working on Linux or Unix based server set the CHMOD settings of directories to 755 and set CHMOD of all .php files to 644.
d. Login as an administrator into e107, go to Plugin Manager, install EasyShop and you can start defining the settings.

2. Upgrading
============
2a. from jbShop v1.1:
First, download a copy of EasyShop 1.2 first, perform the upgrade following the readme.txt instructions from there. After a succesful conversion, overwrite the EasyShop 1.2 files with the EasyShop 1.3 files, go to Admin Area > Plugin Manager > perform the upgrade for EasyShop.

2b. from EasyShop v1.2x:
Overwrite the EasyShop 1.2x files with the EasyShop 1.31 files, go to Admin Area > Plugin Manager > perform the upgrade for EasyShop. NOTE: this means that EasyShop 1.2x or 1.3 installations have to install and upgrade to 1.31 first before installing 1.4.

2c. from EasyShop v1.3
Overwrite the EasyShop 1.3 files with the EasyShop 1.31 files, go to Admin Area > Plugin Manager > perform the upgrade for EasyShop. NOTE: this means that EasyShop 1.2x or 1.3 installations have to install and upgrade to 1.31 first before installing 1.4.

Quick Upgrading troubleshooting
===============================
If your upgrade to a newer EasyShop version fails in the Plugin Manager, always perform: Admin Area > Database > Check Database validity > Click the box from 'easyshop' and click on the button 'Start Verify'. Select all checkboxes with an error and click the button 'Fix errors' at the bottom of the screen.
Note: e107 0.7.8 will give permanent errors on the indexes; this is a bug in the validity check and will not harm the working of the EasyShop plugin.

Styling your EasyShop
=====================
The following style classes have been introduced to style the Main Category Name, Category Name or Product Name to your own personal preference:
1. .easyshop_main_cat_name: style the description of the main category  (introduced in 1.4)
2. .easyshop_cat_name: style the description of the category
3. .easyshop_prod_name: style the description of the product

If you do not specify the styles the size, color, background etc. will be as your regular style settings.
Example to add to your style.css of your theme (which will set the font size to twelve pixels for all of the above mentioned descriptions):
.easyshop_prod_name, .easyshop_cat_name, .easyshop_main_cat_name {
  font-size: 12px;
}
Example to change the border style color to white:
